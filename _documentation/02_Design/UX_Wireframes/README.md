# UX Wireframes

## Purpose
This directory contains low-fidelity wireframes that map out user flows and screen layouts.

## Tools
- Figma
- Sketch
- Balsamiq
- Hand-drawn sketches (photographed/scanned)

## File Organization
Organize wireframes by feature or user flow:
- `Feature_Name_Wireframe.fig`
- `Feature_Name_UserFlow.png`

## Naming Convention
- Use descriptive names that map to user stories
- Include version numbers for iteration tracking
- Example: `US001_Dashboard_Layout_v2.png`

## Wireframe Guidelines
1. **Focus on Layout:** Not colors or final styling
2. **Show User Flow:** How users navigate through features
3. **Annotate:** Add notes explaining interactions
4. **Mobile-First:** Consider responsive layouts
