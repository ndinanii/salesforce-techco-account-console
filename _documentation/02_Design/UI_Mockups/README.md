# UI Mockups

## Purpose
This directory contains high-fidelity mockups that show the final visual design using SLDS components and styling.

## Tools
- Figma (with SLDS UI Kit)
- Adobe XD
- Sketch

## File Organization
Organize mockups by screen or component:
- `Screen_Name_Mockup.fig`
- `Component_Name_States.png`

## Naming Convention
- Use descriptive names aligned with functional specs
- Include state variations (default, hover, error, loading)
- Example: `Dashboard_ListView_Desktop.png`

## Mockup Requirements
1. **SLDS Compliance:** Use only SLDS components and patterns
2. **Responsive Views:** Show desktop, tablet, and mobile layouts
3. **State Variations:** Default, hover, active, disabled, error, loading
4. **Annotations:** Explain interactions and component behavior
5. **Accessibility Notes:** Color contrast ratios, keyboard navigation
