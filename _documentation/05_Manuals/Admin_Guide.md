3. Click **New**
4. Define criteria or ownership-based rule
5. Specify who to share with and access level
6. Click **Save**

### Field-Level Security

**To modify field-level security:**
1. Navigate to **Setup → Object Manager → [Object] → Fields & Relationships**
2. Click on field name
3. Click **Set Field-Level Security**
4. Configure visibility and editability per profile
5. Click **Save**

### Permission Set Assignments

**To assign permission sets:**
1. Navigate to **Setup → Users → Permission Sets**
2. Click on permission set name
3. Click **Manage Assignments**
4. Click **Add Assignments**
5. Select users
6. Click **Assign**

## Data Management

### Data Backup

**Recommended Frequency:** Weekly

**Methods:**
1. **Data Export Service** (Setup → Data → Data Export)
   - Schedule automatic weekly/monthly exports
   - Exports as CSV files
2. **Third-Party Backup Solutions:**
   - OwnBackup
   - Spanning
   - Druva

### Data Import

**Using Data Loader:**
```bash
# Install Data Loader
# Download from: https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/data-loader

# Command-line import
process.bat [process-conf.xml]
```

**Best Practices:**
- Always test in sandbox first
- Back up data before bulk updates
- Use External IDs to prevent duplicates
- Validate data after import

### Data Quality

**Duplicate Management:**
1. Navigate to **Setup → Data → Duplicate Management**
2. Configure Matching Rules
3. Configure Duplicate Rules
4. Test with sample data

**Validation Rules:**
- Document all validation rules in ERD documentation
- Test validation rules before deploying

### Data Archiving

**Strategy:**
- Archive records older than [X years]
- Use Big Objects for long-term storage
- Maintain audit trail of archived records

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Issue: Users Cannot See Records

**Possible Causes:**
1. OWD settings too restrictive
2. Missing sharing rules
3. Profile/Permission Set lacks Read permission
4. Role hierarchy not configured

**Resolution:**
1. Check OWD settings (Setup → Sharing Settings)
2. Verify user's profile has Read permission
3. Check sharing rules
4. Use "Sharing" button on record to see why user has/doesn't have access

#### Issue: Apex CPU Time Limit Exceeded

**Possible Causes:**
1. Inefficient SOQL queries in loops
2. Complex trigger logic
3. Governor limit hit during bulk operations

**Resolution:**
1. Review Apex debug logs
2. Optimize queries (use selective filters, limit results)
3. Move complex logic to asynchronous processing (Queueable, Batch)
4. Implement trigger framework to prevent recursion

#### Issue: Scheduled Job Not Running

**Possible Causes:**
1. Job aborted due to errors
2. Maximum scheduled jobs limit reached
3. Job scheduled with incorrect timezone

**Resolution:**
1. Check **Setup → Apex Jobs** for error messages
2. Review debug logs for the scheduled class
3. Abort and reschedule the job
4. Verify timezone settings

#### Issue: Integration Failure

**Possible Causes:**
1. Named Credential expired
2. External system down
3. API limits exceeded
4. Network connectivity issues

**Resolution:**
1. Test external endpoint manually (Postman)
2. Verify Named Credential authentication
3. Check API usage limits
4. Review Remote Site Settings (Setup → Remote Site Settings)

### Debug Logs

**To enable debug logs:**
1. Navigate to **Setup → Debug Logs**
2. Click **New**
3. Select user or Automated Process
4. Set log level (e.g., FINEST for Apex, DEBUG for Database)
5. Set expiration time
6. Click **Save**

**Analyzing Logs:**
- Filter by operation (e.g., SOQL_EXECUTE, DML_INSERT)
- Look for governor limit warnings
- Identify long-running operations

- Monitor for errors

### Rollback Plan
- Keep backup of previous metadata version
- Document rollback steps for each release
- Test rollback procedure in sandbox

---

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Health Check

## Appendix

### Useful SOQL Queries

```sql
-- Find users who haven't logged in recently
SELECT Id, Name, LastLoginDate FROM User WHERE IsActive = true AND LastLoginDate < LAST_N_DAYS:30

-- Check Apex job status
SELECT Id, Status, JobType, ApexClass.Name, CompletedDate FROM AsyncApexJob WHERE JobType = 'BatchApex' ORDER BY CompletedDate DESC

-- Find records with missing required fields
SELECT Id, Name FROM Account WHERE Industry = null
```
