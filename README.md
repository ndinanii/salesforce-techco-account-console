# TechCo: The "Single Pane of Glass" Account Console

This project streamlines the workflow for Account Managers by consolidating critical information into a "single pane of glass" interface within Salesforce, reducing "click fatigue" and improving productivity.

## 1. Business Challenge

Account Managers were inefficiently "swivel-chairing" between multiple screens and tabs to get a complete picture of an account. This wasted time and led to frustration.

## 2. My Role & Strategic Solution

As a Junior Salesforce Strategist, I designed a **"single pane of glass" interface** to consolidate critical information in one place, streamlining the Account Manager's workflow.

### Phase 1: Workflow Analysis

- **Business Goal:** Identified the key data points an Account Manager needs *at a glance*, such as account details, a list of open opportunities, and a chart of opportunity stages.
- **Platform Strategy:** Determined that a standard Lightning Page required enhancement with custom components to deliver a superior user experience.

### Phase 2: Hybrid UI Development

- **Business Goal:** Present data in the most effective and visually intuitive format.
- **Platform Strategy:** Implemented a modern, hybrid technical stack to build a seamless user experience on a single **Lightning Record Page**.
    - **Lightning Web Component (LWC):** Chosen for its speed and efficiency to build a dynamic "Opps by Stage" chart.
    - **Visualforce Page:** Used as a practical solution to display a simple list of "Account Details," demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the platform's full toolkit.

## 3. Strategist's Note

> This solution demonstrates a practical understanding of the Salesforce UI framework. LWC wasn't used just because it's new; it was used because it was the best tool for the job. This hybrid approach solved the business problem efficiently while showcasing the ability to build and maintain a flexible, user-centric UI.
